# Manik Manavenddra M
AI Engineer | Full-Stack Developer | Production AI Systems

I build end-to-end AI systems — from model logic to scalable production backends and clean user interfaces.  
My work focuses on **LLM-powered applications**, **retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)**, **AI agents**, and **developer tooling** designed for real-world usage, not demos.

This profile highlights my most representative projects. Each one solves a concrete problem and is built with production constraints in mind: performance, maintainability, and extensibility.

## Engineering Philosophy

- Production > prototypes  
- Deterministic outputs over vague AI responses  
- Systems thinking over isolated features  
- Maintainability matters more than cleverness  

I design software to be **understandable, extensible, and deployable**, not just impressive in a demo.
